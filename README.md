# Azure Functions Development Demo

This is a demo repository for various Azure Functions triggers and bindings. It contains few samples to demostrate how to use different triggers and bindings in Azure Functions.

It is intended for learning and experimentation purposes and it is not meant for production use. It uses local storage emulators and other development tools to simulate Azure services.

It is recommended to use this repository in conjunction with the official Azure Functions documentation and other learning resources.

It is assumed that you have some basic knowledge of Azure Functions and C# programming.

It is using Visual Studio 2026 and .NET 10, which are the latest versions as of Jan 2026.

Last, it is doing a hello world type of implementation for each trigger and binding, to keep things simple and focused on the core concepts.
